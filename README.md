## Description
This website needed to be made sure of full functionality. By clicking on virtually everything on the site to see what needed to be reacted to, I was able to see that this was a one-page designed website; if I clicked something on the top tabs, it would take me to that section on the same page.

This project was built to help us understand how certain elements function on a web page then to 

I learned that I need to get way better at semantic HTML as I still don't understand how to do that well, yet.


Changes?

- Changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon" so viewers will know name of site within looking at the tab alone
- Line 30 added <a id="search-engine-optimization" and closed it with /a> on line 36 after the search engine optimization content

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Known Bugs

- When clicking the "Search Engine Optimization" on the top right of the webpage, there was no function. It was expected to jump to the content about it on the same page. **Fixed:** Added an a id and open the anchor bracket before the content and closed it after the content
